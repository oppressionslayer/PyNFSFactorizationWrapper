# PyNFSFactorizationWrapper
This is a wrapper to Alperton's SIQS / NFS / ECM factorization library. It is very fast, factor an 88 digit number in 7 minutes
""" To use this library, use:
    from sfactorint import p2ecm 

    To build ecm, from the primality test directory, simply do
    cd calculators
    make
    cd ..
    ipython3
    from sfactorint import p2ecm
"""

Also i can't get this to buildin osx, only ubuntu or linux. Please have fun this is Alpertong's factorization in with a python Wrapper! Very fast factorization of large numbers!
